<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

<li>
     <h4>HTML Troubles</h4>
    <p>
        For the add comment portion, I tried adding it as an appendage to the renderOneHikeFull function in hike.js. <br>
        It works, it shows a text field for the comment div, an  option selection and a submit button. <br>
        For some reason the onclick function on the submit button button doesn’t work. It says that the function attached to it isn’t called yet. <br>
        I think it has something to do with hikes.js just being a module. I tried to import the function for the button but it still doesn’t work.  <br>
        The solution I came up with is to add another js file (main.js) which was used  as a normal js file. The onlick functionality on the button worked.

    <h4>Displaying/Hiding the Add a comment page</h4>

    <p>
        Since the commentDiv is hard coded in HTML, I used the .style.display option in Javascript. <br>
        It says “none” when all hikes is displayed and says “block” when the selected hike is displayed.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Filtering the comments</h4>
    <p>
        I got help from the renderOneHikeFull function, when that function is called a hike is passed though it.<br>
     I used that function to call on the Addcomment Function which passes the name of the hike. <br>
     This is then compared via for and if statements to the array that has all the comments. <br>
      When the name on the array matches the name of the hike, the right comment is displayed.
    </p>
