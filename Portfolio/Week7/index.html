     <h4>Proper Planning thoughts</h4>
    <p>
     I underestimated this challenge. I thought it was easier than it really was. I think I didn't read the instructions <br>
     as well as I should. I did the div placements first to have the site look at the way it should on the wireframe, <br>
     initially I was only passing text through the div boxes, which was easy. I didn't realize I need to create an object and <br>
     an array for the toDoList and toDo which was challenging
