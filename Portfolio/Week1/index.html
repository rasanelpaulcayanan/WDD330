<h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Week One 1</h2>

<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>This week I tried to create a similar program to the story editor.</p>
<p>Instead of saving stories the program allows a customer to order pizza. It does the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Generates an order #</li>
    <li>Allows user to submit the order (Save)</li>
    <li>Allows end user to load an order, using the order #</li>
    <ul><a href="../Week1/order.html">Click Here to Order</a></ul>
</ol>

<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
<p>When I was on Web Frontend 1, we always started the designs on a small viewpoint. <br>
I didn’t understand the value of it that time other than being able to see my web creations on my phone. <br>
Watching the video made me realize how important that mindset was. 
<br>It does make sense to create web pages based on the demand, and it looks like in the coming years people <br> 
will be using mobile devices more and more, while desktops get phased out. <br>
In our company, they have started to migrate people from desktops to laptops.</p>

<p>
    I think password masking if vital for larger screen resolutions like laptops, desktops where the <br> 
likelihood of other people seeing your password is very high, especially if you’re in a public place. <br> 
if you’re using a mobile phone, it is easier for users to have an option to just hide it. <br> 
I can’t count the times I’ve been frustrated in having to login because I didn’t have an option to see the password I typed.
</p>

<p>
    I didn’t know there was a way to just program an application or website to bring up the number pad automatically. <br>
    I think that’s a good suggestion I would like to include in my next website. 
</p>

<p>Am I the only user who just exits out of applications or websites because of excessive ads? Though I know that the inclusion of ads is necessary for revenue, <br>
     but annoying the users will not lead to additional conversion.</p>

  <p>
     Question: <br>
     Question on Android and the newer IPhones Accessibility, if we put the most used icons/menus at the bottom of the screen wouldn’t that <br>
      risk the site or app from being closed? While it is true that it is easier to access the menu buttons when they <br>
      are at the bottom of the screen, for me I would still want them at the top.<br>
      Where a user wouldn’t accidentally hit the back or exit buttons.
