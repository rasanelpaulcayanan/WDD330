<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

<li>
     <h4>Thoughts on Object Oriented Programming</h4>
     <p>Object oriented programming seems like a better way to come up with a program and work on its attributes. <br>
         The examples on the Ninja Turtles were great. They are turtles (object) and have different attributes (name, weapons etc.). </p>

    <h4>Team Activity Progress</h4>
    <p>I was in charge of step 2 of the team assignment. We tried a different approach this week and split the team assignment so that comes <br>
        the team meeting all 3 of us will have something else to share.    Here is my initial draft, ugly right? <br>
        I’m thinking how I can change this to object oriented programming. I probably want an object called tictactoe game. <br>
         Then separate the game attributes to different functions like. Turns – determines which turn is it (player 1 or player 2), <br>  
         squares – the 9 squares in the tic tac toe board, clickcounter – something that tells how many times the squares has been clicked, 
         winnningpatters – tells the game what patters are considered wins. What a daunting task…
         </p>

    <h4>More Team Activity Notes...</h4>
    <p> Progress on Tictactoe javscript. The code below does the following things: a. Check who’s turn it is. B. <br>
        Based on that turn determines what type of value is placed when the tile is touched.</p>

    <h4>More Team Activity Notes...Again...</h4>
    <p> The code is done. I attribute the success to event.target that was the key to this program. <br>
        It told the program which divbox the end user was clicking(touching) and I was able to use that to <br>
        add it to an array. The array determines if the turns are completed or who wins. This is done by having <br>
        set arrays for winning combinations. In tictactoe there are only 8 winning combinations. 3 Horizontal, <br>
        3 Vertical and 2 Diagonal combinations. I created a code that combines the winning combinations to the current tictactoe positioning.</p>

    <h4>Thoughts on Game Developers</h4>
    <p> Reflection on how difficult it is to create games. It literally took me days to work on a simple tictactoe game logic. <br>
         As someone who played a lot of online games it helped see game developers for the absolute geniuses that they really are <br>
          and understand how it takes months or years to come up with a decent game.</p>
