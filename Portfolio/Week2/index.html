<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

<ol>
    <li> <h4>What's the deal with the $ symbol</h4> 
        <p>This was one of my questions today. This was the first time I got introduced to this symbol <br>
        <p>After a brief research and watching a Youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acm-MD_6934"> Link Here</a></p> it started to make sense <br>
        <p> Sample Code: <br>
            var subject = 'WDD330' <br>
            console.log(`I love love ${user}.`);
        </p>
         <p>It turned out not as complicated as I thought it was, it was a a valid identifier used in Javscript!</p>

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>split()?</h4>
        <p>This is also a topic that I had hard time following while reading the book, it seemed that the book didn't really explain how to use it</p>
        <p>I tried using sentence.split(), sentence being the variable for the sentence I wanted to split and got no results</p>
        <p>It turned out that I just needed to add a " ". sentence.split(" ") adding the character in between the parenthesis that tells the command where you want the split to take place </p>
        <p>This tells the code, hey I want to split this at the end of each spaces.</p>
        <p> Side note: While looking up Split I had more references to the Movie Split than the actual Javascript topic I wanted to search
