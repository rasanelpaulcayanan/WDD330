<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

     <h4>It is harder to work someone elses code.</h4>
    <p>
        I don’t know why but I always had problems working a different person’s code.  <br>
        I think when you make a code from scratch you just know the ins and outs and it’s much easier to make <br>
        sense of what’s going on and what’s not acting right. For the earthquake code challenge, it was difficult to <br>
        figure out what I’m supposed to get and what’s not working. One good example was the getJSON function. It took <br>
        me quite to figure it out. I’m calling the function but nothing is happening. Turns out that on the function call <br>
        getJSON was expecting a url. I got that out of the way and got a response.

    <h4>What’s supposed to happen?</h4>
   <p>
    Now I have the function called and a response from the site. I don’t really see anything here. Unlike the Starwars API on <br>
    the response you get some sort of array. Here you just get an array with the Link, status 200, and redirected. <br>
    I tried to check that url (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?f%E2%80%A6t=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-02-02 ) <br>
    the page get’s me an error saying there’s too many results to show. <br>
I did check this other link (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-02-02 ) and  <br>
I saw a page with JSON data. What’s funny was there a part of the JSON that seemed like coordinates example (-176.8628,-23.709,90.6) this <br>
 was part of an array Element for an earthquake in Fiji but when you google it the coordinates is for somewhere in Bangladesh.
