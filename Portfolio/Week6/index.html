<ol>
    
<li>
     <h4>Proper Planning thoughts</h4>
    <p>
     I underestimated this challenge. I thought it was easier than it really was. I think I didn't read the instructions <br>
     as well as I should. I did the div placements first to have the site look at the way it should on the wireframe, <br>
     initially I was only passing text through the div boxes, which was easy. I didn't realize I need to create an object and <br>
     an array for the toDoList and toDo which was challenging
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Surprise local storage only takes in text</h4>
    <p>
        This was tricky when trying to work on arrays. Since you have an object and array for  the to do list, you can just pass <br>
        the object and array to local storage. You can, but you wont be able to get anything out of it. So you have use JSON.stringify <br>
        to convert your array to text, then pass it to local storage. You cant really do anything with a text converted array so you have <br>
        to bring it back to an array by doing JSON.parse.
    </p>
</li>

    <h4>taskList.completed was so much helpful for this program</h4>
    <p>Another one of my challenges was the check box, it has to be changed when clicked. How do I do that for all the tasks that has already been completed? <br>
      I created a task called changeImage that runs a loop through all the array items and if they are already completed, it changes the image. The array item <br>
      is marked completed through the strike function. It underlines the text then marks the Completed variable true instead of the default false. 
    </p> 
</li>

<li>
    <h4>All, Completed and Active</h4>
    <p>
        For this ones I just copied the display functions. All pretty much displays everything while for Completed and Active the taskList.completed came in handy again <br>
        I created loops then a if statement that if completed is true then it displays in completed. if completed is false it displays in the active tab.
    </p>
</li>


<li>
    <h4>Why stars?</h4>
    <p>
        it's a pun. "Aim for the stars.". Hehe.
    </p>
