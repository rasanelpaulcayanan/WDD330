<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

<ol>
    
<li>
     <h4>Debugging thoughts</h4>
     <p>1.	My go to debugging method has always been the console in Chrome.  <br>
         Going through the breakpoints always helped me determined where the issue is and what I’m not getting. <br>
         It also helps that the console shows which line you had errors with.

    <h4>Great Hikes My recommendation:</h4>
    <p>
Put the image over the picture <br>
Picture is smaller to not take the entire page <br>
Center the content <br>
Add descriptions (This are in the array but not part of the page) <br>
Add directions (This are in the array but not part of the page) <br>
Real images for each hike trail (Image used is default falls.jpg) <br>

    </p>

    <h4>CORS error when importing module</h4>
    <p>It’s hard to work the modules. I got the CORS error and took me a day to find out that  <br>
        I have to use a web server to work of that. I was able to export hikes.js but did more of the  <br>
        coding on main.js (which was cheating based on what my group mates said.. we had a laugh) We figured how <br> 
        to get the functions to work. (Previously I got the Hikes class to work but not the other functions). <br>
         We did the whole exercise again and got to CORE requirement 3. </p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Stretch Goals thoughts</h4>
    <p>For the stretch goals, I want to use a toggle function that makes the descriptions <br>
         of the hike name appear or disappear when clicked. I think I can use some of the same code <br>
          that I used in the tictactoe game to make this work.</p>
