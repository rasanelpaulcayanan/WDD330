     <h4>Animations! CSS!</h4>
    <p>
        The rest of the semester has been leaned on Javscript, ES6, I’m excited to mix it up a bit <br>
        I enjoy working on the CX side of things and making sites more attractive to the eye. <br>
        Update: <br>
        I’m a little sad I wasn’t able to incorporate as much styling as I wanted…  <br>
        It was hard to get the  javascript working on its own. But I still managed to put Darth Vader up there which is something. <br>
        .

    <h4>Trouble with fetch</h4>

    <p>
        I spent hours trying to get fetch to work. <br>
        Just like any functions you first check if you can get to run a function to run without an error. <br>
         I finally did. The next step I did is if I can get to console.log an array from the SWAPI. <br>
          just cant. After a lot of tries I realized that I’m on the wrong tab of Console. No errors is selected. <br>
          That’s why I don’t see any messages in console. When I switched to the Messages tab, there it was the whole time 
    </p>

    <h4>The tricky page numbering</h4>

    <p>
        It was hard to get the page numbers. The JSON file doesn’t really have that. <br>
         What we did is we took the last character from the nextpage so if the next page <br>
         URL shows as: https://swapi.dev/api/people/?page=2 we take out the last character of that string (2). <br>
          So 2 is your next page, if you minus that by 1 then you get your current page.. (1).
