     <h4>Alerts in real life.</h4>
    <p>
        For me nothing is more frustrating than going to a website and expecting to see information that <br>
        I needed than getting an Alert for a product subscription asking for my email. So I think that’s right it should be used with care.<br>
        You could use form elements to gather information as well as check where users want to go on certain sites.

<li>
    <h4>	Using the browser history</h4>
   <p>
    There was a project for the site website, I wonder if you could use the window.history.go command on that back button.
   </p>

    <h4>Stretch Goal One and Two:</h4>
   <p>
    This is one is tricky. I need to implement a counter for each key stroke. Once that’s done I created a switch function <br>
    within that switch function each key has a corresponding case statement that 1. Adds to the counter 2. An If statement that <br>
    if the counter reaches 10, the reset value is true. The movedown function is then called. Which does exactly what the name says,<br>
     it moves the key down by adding a moveDown class. Once the counter reaches 10, and the reset is true, the moveDown class is removed<br>
      which resets the position.
   </p>
