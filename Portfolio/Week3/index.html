<h3>Notes/Questions</h3>

<ol>
    <li> <h4>Trouble with getDay().</h4> 
        <p>I was playing around with the new Date() function. I created an object birthday which is (1990, 9, 29) <br>
             *Not my real birthday. I quickly realized my mistake after the toString() function. My birthday is <br>
              supposed to be September not October. So I created another object <realbirthday class="br"></realbirthday>
             For some reason getDay works on birthday but not realbirthday.  

        </p>

        <h3>Code Snippet</h3>

<li>
     <h4>Document Object Model</h4>
     <p>I found this chapter really interesting. This probably is one of the hardest topics for me when it comes to javascript. <br>
          Getting the HTML to do exactly what you want was a challenge for me. Selecting the right element/content was also tough. <br>
          If you also noticed, I was limited to the document.getElementById command. I didn’t really use others. <br>
          This chapter introduced me to other commands I could use to interact with HTML that I plan to use in this week’s activities.</p>
